| Aug 22 | 1:15-1:45 | I looked at the first puzzle which was a bunch of letters, so I wanted to first check if it was a caesar cipher (very common encrypytion). I noticed that for a three letter word that seemed like "the," all of the letters were 9 away from "the" so I figured out the rest. The next once had a bunch of two-digit numbers, which reminded me of ascii, and using an ascii chart table, it sure enough was. The third one was a bunch of zeros and ones so I thought that it must have been binary. We inputted 8 numbers at a time (a byte of data, representing the alphabet), and after a few, words began to form, so I figured it must be correct. Still working on figuring out the 4th one... |
|  Aug 25 |   12:28-1:08  |  I began coding out each of the puzzles. I decided to loop through each character in a for loop for the first puzzle, because I figured it would be easy to find the length and interate one at a time. For the second and third puzzle, I decided to loop through until the indices were empty and get the first 2 or 8 indices from the string, before taking a substring with it removed. I had a bit of trouble figuring out how to convert the string of numbers into an actual number and then into a char, but a brief google search helped me figure out that.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Aug 27 | 6:30-7:09 | I finally figured out how to run RiddlerTester, and then I spent the majority of this time debugging. I found issues like, for example, the parseInt function needing a variable 2 to signify that it is binary digits, or only performing a caesar shift for actual letters. I ended up getting 2/3 decryption functions that I coded working, we take those! |
| Aug 29 | 6:50-7:20 | After reviewing the algorithms in class, I wanted to take another stab at each of the riddles, including actually getting an answer for 1 and 4. After discussing the tactical use of modulus for riddle #1, I employed that same code in my own, with checks for if the letter is uppercase or lowercase to ensure the proper shift is being made. For number 2, I decided to combine the use of the text.split() function you mentioned in class as well as the warmup about counting spaces (I decided to go for the approach of initalizing an array after counting all spaces). After that, it is easy to loop through the array and convert the ascii to a char to add it to the string. For #3, I decided to use the bit-shifting we went over in class and that was reinforced when I went to your tutorial. I coded the bit-shifting on my own in order to figure out the value of each binary byte, and from there it was the same approach to convert to alphabet. |
| Aug 29 | 7:20-7:40 | Finally, I tackled #4, using what we discussed in class with unicode and dingbats with a similar caesar shift. Since I learned in class that the dingbats were hexidecimal, I calculated the decimal value of the scissors and shifted it all the way down to 0, then added an 'A' so that the shift could be aligned accordingly. I was originally confused for how to figure out what the shift value would be, but once I realized that the scissors dingbat was supposed to be the A and adjusting to that, the rest of the puzzle I solved fairly easily. |
