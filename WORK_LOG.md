| Aug 22 | 1:15-1:45 | I looked at the first puzzle which was a bunch of letters, so I wanted to first check if it was a caesar cipher (very common encrypytion). I noticed that for a three letter word that seemed like "the," all of the letters were 9 away from "the" so I figured out the rest. The next once had a bunch of two-digit numbers, which reminded me of ascii, and using an ascii chart table, it sure enough was. The third one was a bunch of zeros and ones so I thought that it must have been binary. We inputted 8 numbers at a time (a byte of data, representing the alphabet), and after a few, words began to form, so I figured it must be correct. Still working on figuring out the 4th one... |
|  Aug 25 |   12:28-1:08  |  I began coding out each of the puzzles. I decided to loop through each character in a for loop for the first puzzle, because I figured it would be easy to find the length and interate one at a time. For the second and third puzzle, I decided to loop through until the indices were empty and get the first 2 or 8 indices from the string, before taking a substring with it removed. I had a bit of trouble figuring out how to convert the string of numbers into an actual number and then into a char, but a brief google search helped me figure out that.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Aug 27 | 6:30-7:09 | I finally figured out how to run RiddlerTester, and then I spent the majority of this time debugging. I found issues like, for example, the parseInt function needing a variable 2 to signify that it is binary digits, or only performing a caesar shift for actual letters. I ended up getting 2/3 decryption functions that I coded working, we take those! |
